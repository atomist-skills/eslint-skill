# Find Problems
ESLint statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems. 
ESLint is built into most text editors and you can run ESLint
as part of your continuous integration pipeline.

# Fix Automatically
Many problems ESLint finds can be automatically fixed. ESLint
fixes are syntax-aware so you won't experience errors introduced
by traditional find-and-replace algorithms.
