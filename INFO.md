The ESLint skill runs `[eslint](https://eslint.org/)` on new pushes to your repositories. Use the linting configuration of your choice and apply it to as many repositories as you like in one quick step. Opt to get fixes as pull requests, branch commits, or simply as linting error checks.

Atomist runs the linting for you, so there's no need to set up an environment. It works alongside your continuous integration, and you get fine control over which branches get linted.
